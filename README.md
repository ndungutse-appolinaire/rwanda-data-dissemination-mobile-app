# rwanda-data-dissemination-mobile-app
Overview

The Rwanda Data Dissemination Mobile App is a full-stack web and mobile application designed to disseminate official statistical data through interactive dashboards and geospatial visualizations.
The system supports evidence-based decision-making by making national statistics more accessible to policymakers, institutions, and the public.

This project was developed in the context of official statistics dissemination, with a strong focus on data accessibility, usability, and scalability.

🎯 Problem Statement

Statistical data is often published in static formats that limit accessibility and real-time use by decision-makers and citizens. There is a need for a modern, interactive, and mobile-friendly platform that enables users to explore key indicators and insights efficiently.

✅ Solution

The Rwanda Data Monitor System provides:

A mobile application for public access to statistical summaries

A web dashboard for interactive data visualization

A backend API for managing data access and business logic

A scalable architecture suitable for national-level deployment

🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a modular full-stack architecture consisting of mobile, web, backend, database, and caching layers.

Architecture overview:

Mobile App communicates with Backend via REST APIs

Web Frontend communicates with Backend via REST APIs

Backend handles business logic and database operations

Redis is used for caching to improve performance
